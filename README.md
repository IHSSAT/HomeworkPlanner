# BrainTeam
An app for people who play quizbowl. Dependencies: Python 3, Kivy, and Kivy's dependencies. 

topics are added by querying quizdb.org for the topic. If topic is new or you are bad at it, it is featured first and regularly in the question reader.
Also has a "weighted play" feature; topics that appear more often are more likely to appear in your practice. 

Somewhere in this github repository is a list of topics that appear the most frequently, queried from Quinterest, by answers. 
It is not integrated into the app in any way. Also Quinterest is dead. Worth noting that ~5.5% of topics are ~30% of tossups, and ~12% of
topics are 50% are tossups.

App is for review, not learning. Many buttons don't work yet lol. Maybe more additions later. Basic function of project works.

Standalone exe compiled is like 70 mb because depencencies so don't try to compile it lmao
